## Github Pages

**[Link to the GitHub Pages website](https://amillsy.github.io/Creating-a-Portfolio-Site-Week-2/ "Portfolio page website")**

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## What I have learnt

This project has developed my understanding of the entirety of HTML and CSS to a large extent by having to do this without the help of a tutor so whenever I had a problem, I had to understand what was wrong and then learn from my mistakes. By doing this, I have learnt a huge amount about how to create a semantic website that uses all the modern CSS and HTML standards so that an end user can resize and reshape their browser and still be able to have a readable and enjoyable experience when
viewing the page.

Furthermore, it has helped me understand how to layout my pages. When doing this project I made wireframes of the website which increased my efficiency massively, as I didn't get stuck wondering about how the page should be laid out.

Lastly, I have learnt about the importance of having a good structure and layout in my CSS files and also having comments that support some of my Classes so that when I come back at a later date, I understand what is going on within each class.

## Usage

I would be able to display all my portfolio on a single website, where a user or employee would be able to access this main website and then see all of my previous projects. Great for having everything in a central location as the employee would be able to easily move throughout the site.

They would be able to get all the main details as there is:

### About me:

### Projects:

This was the hardest section to make on the page, as I wanted to have interactive cards that people could hover over and click on, doing something this challenging with CSS and HTML taught me how to adapt my CSS into smaller sections and how to develop complicated things by breaking them down into smaller steps.
